  	<h5>Preparation</h5>
  	<div>
  	  <ol>
  	    <li>The first thing in making kibbeh nayeh is to prepare 
  	    the bulgar wheat. Soak the fine bulgar wheat in water for 
  	    40 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
  	    <br>
  	    <li>Drain the bulgar wheat. The bulgar should be 
  	    soft when ready. Peel and quarter the onion. </li>
  	    
  	    <br>
  	    <li>Split the meat into three batches. 
  	    Ground the first two in a food processor and 
  	    place them in a large bowl. </li>
  	    <br>
  	    <li>Put the third batch in the food processor 
  	    along with the raw onion and spices and process. 
  	    Add this onion mixture to the rest of the ground meat. </li>
  	    <br>
  	    <li>Add the bulgur to the meat and start kneading 
  	    the mixture with your hands until everything is mixed 
  	    together (it takes around 5-7 minutes so keep mixing). 
  	    If you feel the mixture needs it, place your hands in a 
  	    bowl of cold water and then mix again. </li>
  	    <br>
  	    <li>Once everything is combined, shape the mixture 
  	    into a large ball. Move it to the serving dish and 
  	    start patting it down until it covers the entire 
  	    serving plate.  </li>
  	    <br>
  	    <li>Use a fork to make lines across the kibbeh nayeh. </li>
  	    <br>
  	    <li>Drizzle with olive oil. Decorate with greens or mint. </li>
  	    
  	    
  	  </ol>
